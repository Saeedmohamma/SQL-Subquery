**A subquery, or nested query, is a query placed within another SQL query**
There are several types of SQL subqueries:

Scalar subqueries return a single value, or exactly one row and exactly one column.
Multirow subqueries return either:
One column with multiple rows (i.e. a list of values), or
Multiple columns with multiple rows (i.e. tables).
Correlated subqueries, where the inner query relies on information obtained from the outer query.
